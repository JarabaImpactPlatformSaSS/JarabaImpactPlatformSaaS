```
Thanks @contributor! [specific positive feedback]

I reviewed:
- [ ] Issue summary completeness

- [ ] Coding standards
- [ ] Manual testing: [describe what you tested]

[Findings or approval - be specific with line numbers/examples]

```

**Structure:** Always use three parts:
1. **Thank** - Acknowledge what was done well
2. **Document your review** - List exactly what you checked
3. **Provide feedback** - Specific issues or approval with next steps

**Set status appropriately:**
- **Needs Work** - Issues found
- **Needs Review** - Partial review or changes made
- **RTBC** - Complete review, everything passes
